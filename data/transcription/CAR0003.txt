I wouldn't say well balanced. I'm trying to eat healthier, but it doesn't always happen. Okay. And how about exercise? Do you find that your exercise levels or activity levels have gone down in the last two months? Yes. Okay. All right. Is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something I may have missed to ask you today? No, I don't think so. Okay. So based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down in your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on as well as your history that you might be having what's called a congestive heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if this, that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like mylasics or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body, which may be caused by heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there.
